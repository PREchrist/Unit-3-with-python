INVENTORY Project Unit 3

# Planning
### Definition of problem
I am chosen such a developer of an inventory from the client appointed Khalid Ismail from Somalia, schooling in UWC ISAK JAPAN, the purpose of his order came from his worries with pen and pencils. As said, in his room, he has a bunch of pen including pencils that when he wants to use any of it, he has trouble to finding the exact article betwen them to use. The biggest flaw from the client requisition is that, he sometimes spent minutes before finding the one he was looking for, reason why he asked for an easiest inventory which should model everything for me, he wants to find without looking for it.

### Proposed solution
The inventory has shown it face to be drawn by python. I have chosen by ```python``` because it is my current prgamming language and request from the client could have a set of code from python as well as there is others languages programming which deal with inventory, but for this case, I feel cosy to work with it using python.

### Success criteria
1. easy to choose any pen
1. different categories for color/price/new or old
1. identification of pen most used
1. clarify pen colour
1. needs search button 
1. private access
