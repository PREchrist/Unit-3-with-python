TELOS is an acronym in project management used to define five areas of feasibility that determine whether a project should run or not.

T - Technical - Is the project technically possible?
Yes it is, to implement this project, need for us to involve or concerned with applied and industrial sciences.


E - Economic - Can the project be afforded? Will it increase profit?
For this project, I do not need more than I have such computer and internet, if so it will be really cheap, to say less than  1 dollar. For short, through this project, I do not need money.


L - Legal - Is the project legal?
The project is concerning a man who in his room, he has two much of stuff in disorder and he just to bring a specific order for a group of his stuffs. So even this project cannot break any law or commit damage for others users. 


O - Operational - How will the current operations support the change?


S - Scheduling - Can the project be done in time?
This question is treaky to be respond, because as things progress, there will be a meeting or contact with the client to let me know about, so it can be done before the deadline or barely in the deadline. So there is no position from this moment
